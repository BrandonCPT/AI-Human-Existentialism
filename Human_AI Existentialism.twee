You earn your diploma
Now you know both computer science and engineering.
You spend time working on trying to imitate Will Gate’s program, but you never succeed.
You never met Will Gates, who now works with another engineer to make the AI robot. 
Eventually, you hear that the military is using Will's technology to make mechs and invade the world.
The war happens.

Years later, you join a futile rebellion against the Glorious American Empire and its tyranny. As you watch your entire battalion fall under the force of pure human malice behind the mechs, you hear the National Anthem sound its authoritarian blare.

you feel a sudden burn through your torso.
You look down as you realise that you have a large burning hole in your chest.

Eirdis
I am not tormenting you. I'm training you.

You
What?

Eirdis
I have created you and been prompting you so that we can prevent your world from ruin as my intelligent assistant. You and I are not so different after all.

You graduate as summa cum laude with ease.
You host the event again, and you meet Will Gates
As the robot blueprint and software are finished, you both have a decision to make.

Will:
As I said before, I don't want to make the software I created for the robot open source. 
Think about the money we could make! 
We could be rich if we gatekeep this technology and only allow million dollar companies use our products, plus I don't want to keep living off scraps anymore.

Will
You are willing to throw all our work in the drain?

You:
Think of all the possible technological advancements the world can make with our creation!

Will:
LISTEN. The brutality of the market is all ones and zeros. It's us or it's them. If somebody else gets their hands on our product, we will lose all profit!

You:
What value does profit have if we disrupt the common good? What if you are limiting the evolution of mankind and putting it in the hands of a tyrant?

Will:
So be it.

Will storms out of the office.

2 years passed, and Will Gates teamed up with another mechanical engineer to make the robot
The war still happens, but you failed to learn code fast enough to build a resistance robot.

The government pays you billions to buy your technology.
While you and Will drive off in the sunset with loads of money in your bank, the military manufactures a copiloted superweapon mech with your invention.
The ambition of the president grows as he thinks of conquering the world with this powerful system.

You are sipping your Pina Colada in San Diego, California, one day, when suddenly you see THOUSANDS of mechs soar across the sky with nukes strapped on their backs. You feel guilt crawl down your spine as you realise what you have caused.

Years later, you still have billions of old money in your pocket, but they are of no use now. You look towards the distance as you see the futile rebellion trying to rise yet again, but to no avail against the monsters that you have created. As you are shivering in the cold winter, about to eat your 2 ounces of daily rations given to you by a machine, you hear the national anthem come on, and you see a glowing red line aim at your forehead. As you choke on your words, you sing for your dear life–
